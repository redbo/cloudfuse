Cloudfuse is a FUSE application which provides access to Rackspace's
Cloud Files (or any installation of Swift).

Cloud Files is a remote storage system which is similar in principle to
Amazon S3.  It provides a simple RESTful interface to storing and retrieving
objects.

    http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/

Swift, the software behind Cloud Files, has been open-sourced as part of the
OpenStack project.

BUILDING:

    You'll need libcurl, fuse, libssl, and libxml2 (and probably their dev
    packages) installed to build it.  From a base Debian or Ubuntu install,
    this should get you to a point you can build and run it:
        apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev \
             libssl-dev libfuse-dev libjson-c-dev

    For CentOS or similar,
        yum install gcc make fuse-devel curl-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel

    Cloudfuse is built and installed like any other autoconf configured code.
    Normally,
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

    But I'm no autoconf wizard, and there may be dragons lurking there.


USE:

    You'll need to install fuse to use this application. It may have already
    been installed as a dependency if you followed the "BUILDING" instructions
    above.
    
    On Debian:
       apt-get install fuse
       
    On CentOS or similar:
       yum install fuse

    The following settings can be defined in the file ~/.cloudfuse:
        username=[Account username for authentication, required]
        api_key=[API key for authentication with Rackspace]
        tenant=[Tenant name for authentication with Openstack]
        password=[Authentication password with Openstack]
        authurl=[Authentication url, defaults to Rackspace's cloud]
        region=[Regional endpoint to use]
        use_snet=[True to use Rackspace ServiceNet for connections]
        cache_timeout=[Seconds for directory caching, default 600]
        verify_ssl=[False to disable SSL cert verification]

    For authenticating with Rackspace's cloud, at minimum "username" and
    "api_key" must be set.

    For authenticating with Keystone, "username", "password", "tenant", and
    "authurl" should probably be defined.

    These settings can also be specified as mount options on the command line:
        cloudfuse -o username=redbo,api_key=713aa... mountpoint/

    Or as mount options in /etc/fstab:
        cloudfuse /mnt/cloudfiles fuse username=redbo,api_key=713aa...,user 0 0

    It also inherits a number of command-line arguments and mount options from
    the Fuse framework.  The "-h" argument should provide a summary.


EXAMPLE:

    A typical ~/.cloudfuse configuration file for use with Rackspace:
        username=demo
        api_key=643afce8b5187d40ba15e4827384fc5b
        
        # if no region is selected, it will use your default region.
        #   region=DFW
        
        # if connecting within a Rackspace datacenter, ServiceNet can be
        # used to avoid bandwidth charges.
        #   use_snet=true

    A typical ~/.cloudfuse configuration file for use with OpenStack,
    noting that "tenant" should be the tenant name, rather than the ID:
        username=demo
        tenant=demo
        password=supersecret
        authurl=http://10.10.0.1:5000/v2.0

DEBUGGING:
    Cloudfuse may demonstrate the following symptoms:
        - console locks up for minutes
        - error message "Link has been severed"
        
    You can debug these situations in two ways:
        (1) Look at /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages on your swift server
        (2) Use the -d, -f, or debug flag in your cloudfuse config and watch
            the logs or console for errors.
        
    Frequently, these are network or certificate errors.  Swift may not log 
    certificate failures, so the debug switch is important if you're using
    cloudfuse for the first time, particularly in a non-Rackspace environment.
    
    e.g. * Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates
         * About to connect() to 192.168.0.2 port 8080 (#0)
         *   Trying 192.168.0.2... * connected
         * successfully set certificate verify locations:
         *   CAfile: none
           CApath: /etc/ssl/certs
         * SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
         error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
         * Closing connection #0


BUGS/SHORTCOMINGS:

    * rename() doesn't work on directories (and probably never will).
    * When reading and writing files, it buffers them in a local temp file.
    * It keeps an in-memory cache of the directory structure, so it may not be
      usable for large file systems.  Also, files added by other applications
      will not show up until the cache expires.
    * The root directory can only contain directories, as these are mapped to
      containers in cloudfiles.
    * Directory entries are created as empty files with the content-type
      "application/directory".
    * Cloud Files limits container and object listings to 10,000 items.
      cloudfuse won't list more than that many files in a single directory.
